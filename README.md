## Sujeevan Rajagopalan

I am a full stack developer, recently graduated from the Makers Academy 16-week Bootcamp. After working retail for many years, I decided it was time to change careers and Makers was the perfect place for me to get into the world of software development. I believe Makers has given me the right tech stack and concepts to build well-tested and high-quality code wherever the future may take me.

## Experience

**Morrisons** (2009-2020)  
_Checkouts Team Leader_

I have worked in retail for over 10 years, across all parts of the store in various roles. From starting out as a cashier in a customer facing role, moving onto admin and cash-office roles and finally settling a Checkouts Team Leader.

Working in retail I believe I have gained exceptional communication skills, great time management, the ability to work under pressure, experience in problem-solving and taking the initiative, taking responsibility for myself and those working for me and a cultural awareness that come with working with people from all different walks of life.
