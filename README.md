## Sujeevan Rajagopalan

I am a full stack developer, recently graduated from the Makers Academy 16-week Bootcamp. After working retail for many years, I decided it was time to change careers and Makers was the perfect place for me to get into the world of software development. I believe Makers has given me the right tech stack and concepts to build well-tested and high-quality code wherever the future may take me.

## Experience

**Morrisons** (2009-2020)  
_Checkouts Team Leader_

I have worked in retail for over 10 years, across all parts of the store in various roles. From starting out as a cashier in a customer facing role, moving onto admin and cash-office roles and finally settling a Checkouts Team Leader.

Working in retail I believe I have gained exceptional communication skills, great time management, the ability to work under pressure, experience in problem-solving and taking the initiative, taking responsibility for myself and those working for me and a cultural awareness that come with working with people from all different walks of life.

## Skills

**Problem Solving**

I have gained valuable problem-solving skills throughout my many years of working in retail, from having to work with sudden sick calls, to figuring out work schedules for groups of 20+ people and dealing with IT problems in store. I believe that all these problems I have had to work though have showed the me the importance in patience and having a cool head, which had also helped me many times in software development.  Starting at Makers, coding was still very new to me and there were many times we ran into bugs and problems, however breaking problems down into blocks and methodically thinking about them allowed me push through without too much difficulty.

**Communication**

Working retail communication was key to running a smooth store as you could not always be there and if necessary, information was not passed onto relevant parties during other shifts there could be serious consequences. Studying at Makers I realised how important communication was in the world of software development, from networking with fellow coders to pair programming on an almost daily basis. Working in multiple group projects stressed how important it was to talk to people about weaknesses/strengths and be honest about your feelings and thoughts, as to allow a smoother group workflow.
